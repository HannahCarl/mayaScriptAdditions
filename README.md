Hannah_Posch_Object_Window_Script.py - @author Hannah Posch
Code was written to create an easy window with a few of my most used commands when building a scene.

Hannah_Posch_Batch_Render_Script.py - @author Hannah Posch
Code was written to enhance Maya batch render function, as sometimes scene files result in batch render error, or render slower during Maya batch render due to less CPU usage, and this code allows user to utilize the render window for batch rendering.
